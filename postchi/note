now by using 'python' command, we should enter in python 3.x shell!
after that, install all the packages, in the requirements.txt
now every packages are in a directory like: C:\Users\<user>\Envs\<virtualenv-name>\lib\site-packages\
So if the sources needs changing, do it in here!

> if using Python 3.'7', the 'async' word is now reserved! So for the tweepy package, you need to change to source code:
https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy/issues/1017
https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy/pull/1042 (see the file changes and change accordingly)
This will be fixed in the next version of tweepy, but currently, we need to do this manually!
  open <virtual-env-package-dir>\tweepy\streaming.py
  in VS Code, Ctrl + R
  async
  Tab
  is_async
  Replace all
